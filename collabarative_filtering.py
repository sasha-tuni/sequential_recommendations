This program uses a matrix of users and their ratings of a series of movies.
For a selected user, it generates a list of the top n most similar users based
on either Pearson's Correlation or a Cosine Similarity Function.
It then takes this set of n similar users and uses it to predict the rating
that the user of interest would give to any movie they haven't watched.
With that information, it outputs a list of the top n movies to recommend
to our user of interest.
